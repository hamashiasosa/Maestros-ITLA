    <p class="lead">This page was created as a final project that from the beginning was a fairly high idea compared to the level of knowledge we had before starting this project and making it a reality.

                In my mind it was something spectacular, but it was obvious that with little experience as a beginner I was going to be able to achieve everything, however, the result exceeded my expectations and my limits, helping me to improve myself and get a little of the potential that we all have inside.

                Let this small and first project be a boost for all those who are afraid to start "Puyar su computadora" and dare to get out and explore in the beautiful, creative and stressful world of programming.

               <p class="lead"> All this with the help of youtube, google.</p>
                <p class="lead">Made with love and stress</p>
